            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p> &emsp;My name is Lucas Johnson. I have been interested in computers since 8th grade. With this interest I decided to go to
                Vinal Technical High School and took the Information Systems Technology trade. This was a very broad computer class
                but I focused mainly on programming.<br><br>
                
                &emsp;I find programming to be fun and challenging and it is one of my main hobbies. But I also like playing a lot of video games.
                The main game I play is Escape From Tarkov. I also played football until my junior year and played lacrosse my junior and senior year.</p>
